Now, if you go back to Vulnerability -> Reports, and generate a new
detailed report, you should see one less system listed next to the CVE
we fixed.

Of course this only addressed one CVE on one system. To perform this
task at a larger scale you could select all hosts impacted by the CVE,
and then use the Remediate button to either generate a playbook to fix
these systems using Ansible, or remotely execute the fix if you have the
proper subscriptions to do so.
