This lab system is already registered with Red Hat’s
https://cloud.redhat.com[Hybrid Cloud Console] using the Red Hat Remote
Host Configuration utility `+rhc+`. We can view its registration
information with the following command.

....
rhc status
....

You should get output similar to this:

[source,bash]
----
Connection status for rhel-27ff4:

● Connected to Red Hat Subscription Management
● Connected to Red Hat Insights
● The Red Hat connector daemon is active

Manage your Red Hat connector systems: https://red.ht/connector
----

You can see that the system’s hostname is included in the output, in
this case `+rhel-27ff4+` your system will have a similarly formatted,
but different name. You will need this hostname later, so jot it down.

Let’s refresh this hosts insights data, and then continue.

Run the following command on your host

[source,bash]
----
