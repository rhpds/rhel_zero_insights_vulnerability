After providing the report generated in the previous step to your
auditors, they have asked you to find, and fix any vulnerability
classified as Important or Critical. For the purposes of this lab, we
will perform these tasks on just our lab host. To find CVEs on our host
that match this criteria, browse to _Inventory -> Systems_ on the menu
to the left.

. Find the host that matches the hostname of the system in this lab by
pasting the following hostname into the search field.

Select the Vulnerability heading within the host information pane.

.Host Vulnerability

You should see a list of any vulnerability that is impacting this host,
but we want to filter these by severity. Insights makes this simple. You
will see a filter option at the top of the list of vulnerabilities, in
the drop-down list select Severity.

And then in the Filter by severity drop-down, check off both Critical,
and Important. The list of CVE’s should automatically filter down to
just Critical and Important vulnerabilities.

Vulnerabilities]

From this list of vulnerabilities, you can create a remediation playbook
for any, or all, of the CVEs. Or you can view their security advisory,
and remediate manually. With a Smart Management subscription, you can
even launch a remote job to remediate the issue right from this console.

For now, let’s just update the packages related to one of the CVE’s in
the list. Find the CVE id for one of the vulnerabilities in the list,
we’ll use `CVE-2022-3515` for our example.

____
[!NOTE] The CVE id in this example may not be in the list of
vulnerabilities for your host, you should choose one from the list that
Insights is listing for your lab host.
____

Keep your insights web browser open, and in the console for our host
issue the following command, substituting the CVE id in the command for
the one you chose from your list of Vulnerabilities.

[source,bash,run]
----
dnf update -y --cve CVE-2022-3515
----

____
[!NOTE] The `--cve` flag for `dnf` tells it to apply the packages that
are associated with this specific CVE. And `-y` simply tells dnf not to
ask us to confirm the installation.
