Now, let’s make sure insights has reported that the issue has been
resolved. Insights will do this automatically every 24 hours (this is
configurable), but in the interest of time let’s force a sync. You can
do this simply by running `+insights-client+`.

[source,bash]

[source,bash]
----
Starting to collect Insights data for rhel-27ff4
Uploading Insights data.

Once that completes, head back over the the Hybrid Cloud Console, and
into Insights. Find our host in the inventory again, and go to the
vulnerabilities tab.

Note: If you had your host open from our previous exercise you may need
to refresh the page, in order to see the most recent CVE list.

Now if we filter by the CVE id, and search for the CVE we just
remediated, it should be gone from the list.
