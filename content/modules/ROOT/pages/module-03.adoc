Now that you have opened Red Hat Insights Vulnerability, you will see a
summary dashboard of CVEs impacting all of the systems registered to
your organization.

____
[!NOTE] It’s worth mentioning that reports and advisories in Red Hat
Insights can be, but are not always instant. The amount of time between
when changes are made on your host, and when they’ll be reflected on the
Hybrid Cloud Console can vary based on the amount of data currently
being processed by Insights from other Red Hat customers.

For this exercise we are going to generate a report that tells us where
our fleet of systems sits in regards to un-remediated vulnerabilities.
From the CVEs list, you should navigate to Vulnerability -> Reports on
the left-hand side menu.

.Navigate to Vulnerability Reports

Once you are on the Reports page, click on Create Report under Report by
CVEs.

You will be prompted to enter a report title, and filter criteria. For
now let’s leave the report title as is, and select severities of
Critical and Important.

Leave the rest of the form at the defaults, and press export report.

This will generate a report, and then let you download it (or open it in
your browser depending on your browser). This report will give you a
detailed view of what CVEs are un-patched in your environment, and the
number of systems which are impacted by each.

This report is great prep for your annual compliance audit, because it
displays a summary of the industry standard CVE ID, along with other
information to help you or your team assess the threat that each
vulnerability poses.
